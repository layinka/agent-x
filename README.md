## AgentX
Autonomous DeFi Yield optimization agent on Sonic.

AgentX is an autonomous DeFi yield optimization agent designed to maximize returns on stablecoin deposits across  Sonic Network’s leading lending and staking protocols.

AgentX can chat with each user, understand each user's DeFi yield goals, risk tolerance, monitor market conditions and also work round-the-clock to maximize DeFi yeilds.

Imagine an AI agent is like "Yearn Finance Dapp" but can chat with you, understand your yeild farming goals, risk tolerance and learn from market conditions and sentiments including DeFi announcements and public discussions inorder to maximize your DEFI yeilds for you across top yeild opportunities, while you're sleeping or driving.

## DEFI challenges that we are addressing
### Yield/risk evaluation complexity
Periodic need to change DEFI yield strategies due to pool adjustments or protocol security updates.
### Risk-to-yield balance
Periodic need to find a balance between risk and investment returns as market conditions change.
### Round-the-clock monitoring
Periodic need to monitor DEFI announcements, discussions and charts, 24/7, for rapid adaptation to dynamic yield opportunities.

## Solutions
1. Capability to suggest, explain and execute DeFi strategies by understanding users preferences from natural language conversations between AgentX and users.
2. Automated monitoring of DeFi yield pools, protocols and chains powered by DeFillama API and reasoning models.
3. Automated asset allocation and automated rebalancing across lending, staking and liquidity pools powered by Debridge protocol, reasoning models and smart contracts.
4. Auto-compounding of profits powered by AI reasoning models and deployed smart contracts on Sonic mainnet.
